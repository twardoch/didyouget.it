The following issues have been fixed:

1. ✅ **Recording state persistence** - When the app UI is hidden and shown again, the recording state is now properly preserved
   - Fixed by modifying ContentView's onAppear behavior to check if recording is active before resetting state
   - Previous behavior would reset recording state whenever UI reappeared, stopping any active recording

2. ✅ **Empty MOV files issue** - Video files are now properly recorded and contain content
   - Fixed by setting the isRecording flag before capture session setup starts
   - Removed isRecording check in processSampleBuffer to ensure frames are processed during initialization
   - Improved the stream handler to process frames immediately with high priority task dispatch

3. ✅ **Frame processing** - SCStream handler has been improved to properly process and record frames
   - Enhanced logging to better track frame processing
   - Added frame counter to SCStreamFrameOutput to monitor frame reception
   - Improved task priority for frame processing to ensure timely handling
   - Fixed timing issues in the video and audio sample processing methods

The app should now be working properly, recording both video and tracking mouse/keyboard events as expected.

This is the output of `./run.sh` when I click Record and then click Stop, and Record again:
