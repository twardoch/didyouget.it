# Current Issues

## Recording Output Problems

**Issue**: When clicking the Record button, the timer starts and JSON files are created for keyboard and mouse tracking, but:
1. The output MOV file is always zero-length
2. When closing and reopening the app UI, the recording isn't active (state isn't preserved)
3. It's unclear what's being recorded and when it stops

**Observed Behavior**:
- Recording timer starts correctly 
- Mouse and keyboard JSON files are created correctly with events
- Video file is created but has zero length
- Recording state isn't maintained across app UI restarts

**Possible Next Steps**:
1. Debug the video file creation process in RecordingManager
2. Add more logging to verify when video frames are actually captured and written
3. Ensure video asset writer is properly initialized and finalized
4. Add persistent recording state that survives UI refresh

# Previously Fixed Issues

## PreferencesManager Connection

**Issue**: The RecordingManager was failing to find the PreferencesManager during recording.

**Root causes**:
1. Multiple instance initialization issue - new instances weren't getting PreferencesManager
2. Race condition when setting up connections between managers
3. Lack of proper verification before starting recording

**Fixed by**:
1. Adding PreferencesManager verification before recording starts
2. Improved connection in ContentView.onAppear
3. Added better manager state verification in app initialization
4. Added UserDefaults backup system for PreferencesManager connection state

## UI Responsiveness

**Issue**: When clicking the Record button, the UI would freeze.

**Fixed by**:
1. Improved async task handling in recording start process
2. Better state management throughout recording process
3. Fixed concurrency issues in sample buffer processing

**Key Files Modified**:
- DidYouGetApp.swift - App initialization and manager connection
- ContentView.swift - Recording button handler with better error checking
- RecordingManager.swift - Improved state management and preferences access
