# TODO List for Did You Get It Improvements

## Critical Priority - Recording Stability

- [ ] Fix AVAssetWriterInput initialization crash by simplifying video settings dictionary
- [ ] Remove non-standard "RequiresBFrames" key from video compression settings
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanism for video quality settings when hardware limits are reached
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling around AVAssetWriter creation with detailed logging
- [ ] Test recording with various resolution/framerate combinations (1080p@30fps, 1080p@60fps, 4K@30fps)

## High Priority - Application Stability

- [ ] Implement singleton pattern for RecordingManager to prevent multiple instances
- [ ] Fix PreferencesManager dependency injection in DidYouGetApp.swift
- [ ] Add initialization guards to prevent duplicate component creation
- [ ] Clear persisted recording state on app launch unless actively recording
- [ ] Validate recording state before restoration to prevent invalid states
- [ ] Add user notification when restoring crashed recording sessions

## Medium Priority - Code Quality

- [ ] Wrap all debug print statements in #if DEBUG conditional compilation
- [ ] Create a Logger utility class for consistent logging patterns
- [ ] Replace completion handlers with async/await throughout the codebase
- [ ] Implement proper error types instead of NSError for better error handling
- [ ] Remove unused code and commented-out sections
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns across all components

## Architecture Refactoring

- [ ] Define RecordingService protocol for recording operations
- [ ] Define VideoProcessing protocol for video processing operations  
- [ ] Define AudioProcessing protocol for audio processing operations
- [ ] Implement protocol-based architecture to reduce component coupling
- [ ] Create proper dependency injection container
- [ ] Separate UI logic from business logic using coordinator pattern
- [ ] Implement proper actor isolation for thread-safe operations
- [ ] Use AsyncStream for sample buffer processing pipeline

## Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Create unit tests for RecordingManager business logic
- [ ] Create unit tests for VideoProcessor encoding settings
