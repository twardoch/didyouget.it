## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Timer Not Starting and UI Not Updating

**Symptoms:**
- After clicking Record, the timer didn't start running
- Stop button didn't change back to Record button after stopping
- Empty folders created without any files

**Root Causes:**
1. Timer initialization was not properly executed on the main thread
2. UI state updates weren't being synchronized with recording operations
3. Error handling didn't properly reset UI state
4. Stop recording logic didn't update UI immediately

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. Improved timer initialization with proper main thread execution
   ```swift
   await MainActor.run {
       // Timer initialization code on main thread
       let newTimer = Timer.scheduledTimer(withTimeInterval: 0.1, repeats: true) { ... }
       self.timer = newTimer
       RunLoop.current.add(newTimer, forMode: .common)
   }
   ```

2. Fixed UI state updates in stop recording process
   ```swift
   // Immediately update UI state before actual teardown
   isRecording = false 
   isPaused = false
   if let timer = self.timer {
       timer.invalidate()
       self.timer = nil
   }
   ```

3. Fixed warning about unused variable
   ```swift
   // Changed 'var' to 'let'
   let videoSettings: [String: Any] = [
       AVVideoCodecKey: AVVideoCodecType.h264,
       ...
   ]
   ```

### Issue 2: No Files Created in Output Directory

**Symptoms:**
- Empty directories were created, but no video or JSON files
- Recording process appeared to start but didn't generate any output

**Root Causes:**
1. File system permission/setup issues not properly detected
2. Error handling in video asset writer setup was inadequate
3. Capture session might not have been properly starting

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. Added comprehensive file system permission testing
   ```swift
   // Test directory write permissions with a temporary file
   let testFile = folderURL.appendingPathComponent(".write_test")
   try "test".write(to: testFile, atomically: true, encoding: .utf8)
   try FileManager.default.removeItem(at: testFile)
   ```

2. Improved video asset writer initialization with better diagnostics
   ```swift
   // Create and verify an empty placeholder file first
   let data = Data()
   try data.write(to: videoURL)
   // Then create the actual AVAssetWriter
   ```

3. Added better error handling throughout the recording pipeline
   ```swift
   do {
       try await startCapture()
   } catch {
       print("CRITICAL ERROR: Failed during capture session setup: \(error)")
       isRecording = false
       throw error
   }
   ```

4. Added direct file tests for debugging permission issues
   ```swift
   // Test direct file write in error scenarios
   let data = Data([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0])
   try data.write(to: url, options: .atomic)
   ```
