# Work Progress

## Current Session: Code Improvements and Documentation

### Completed Tasks

1. **Documentation Infrastructure** ✅
   - Set up complete MkDocs documentation structure in `src_docs/`
   - Created comprehensive user guides:
     - Installation guide
     - Quick start guide
     - Configuration guide
     - Troubleshooting guide
   - Created feature documentation:
     - Screen recording
     - Audio recording
     - Input tracking
     - Output formats
   - Created development documentation:
     - Architecture overview
     - Building guide
     - Testing guide
     - Contributing guide
   - Created API reference documentation:
     - Core API
     - Recording services
     - UI components
   - Added build script (`build-docs.sh`) for documentation generation

2. **Protocol-Based Architecture** ✅
   - Created `RecordingProtocols.swift` with comprehensive protocol definitions:
     - `RecordingService` - Main recording interface
     - `VideoProcessing` - Video processing interface
     - `AudioProcessing` - Audio processing interface
     - `CaptureSessionProtocol` - Capture session interface
     - `PreferencesProviding` - Preferences interface
   - Implemented protocol conformances:
     - `RecordingManager+Protocol.swift`
     - `VideoProcessor+Protocol.swift`
     - `AudioProcessor+Protocol.swift`
     - `PreferencesManager+Protocol.swift`
   - Created mock implementations for testing:
     - `MockRecordingService`
     - `MockVideoProcessor`
     - `MockAudioProcessor`
     - `MockPreferencesProvider`
   - Created protocol-based tests in `RecordingServiceTests.swift`

3. **Async/Await Migration** ✅
   - Created `SCStreamFrameOutput+Async.swift` with AsyncStream-based frame delivery
   - Created `AsyncFrameProcessor` for concurrent frame processing
   - Created `CaptureSessionManager+Async.swift` with async stream processing
   - Migrated from callback-based to async/await patterns

4. **Error Types and Logging Infrastructure** ✅
   - Created comprehensive `Logger.swift` with:
     - Multiple log levels (verbose, debug, info, warning, error, critical)
     - Category-based logging
     - OS Log integration
     - File logging support
     - Performance measurement utilities
   - Created detailed error types in `Errors.swift`:
     - `VideoError` - Video-specific errors
     - `AudioError` - Audio-specific errors
     - `CaptureError` - Capture-specific errors
     - `FileError` - File operation errors
     - `StateError` - State management errors
     - `ConfigurationError` - Configuration errors
   - Added error recovery suggestions for all error types

5. **Singleton Pattern Implementation** ✅
   - Created `RecordingManager+Singleton.swift`
   - Implemented thread-safe singleton for `RecordingManager`
   - Created `ManagerRegistry` for centralized manager access
   - Added singleton support for `PreferencesManager` and `VersionManager`

### Next Tasks

1. **Fix AVAssetWriter Issues**
   - Remove non-standard video compression keys
   - Implement fallback settings for unsupported configurations
   - Add comprehensive error handling around writer creation

2. **Improve State Management**
   - Fix recording state persistence issues
   - Implement proper state restoration
   - Add state validation before operations

3. **Create Unit Tests**
   - Expand test coverage to 80%+
   - Add integration tests for recording pipeline
   - Create UI tests for critical flows

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile CPU and memory usage
   - Optimize buffer management
   - Implement frame dropping strategy

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Protocol-Oriented Design**: Adopted protocol-based architecture for better testability and flexibility
2. **Async/Await**: Migrated from callbacks to modern Swift concurrency
3. **Structured Logging**: Implemented comprehensive logging with categories and levels
4. **Error Handling**: Created detailed error types with recovery suggestions
5. **Documentation**: Used MkDocs with Material theme for comprehensive documentation

### Issues Encountered

1. **Compatibility**: Maintained backward compatibility while introducing new patterns
2. **Testing**: Need to expand test coverage significantly
3. **Performance**: Frame processing needs optimization for high frame rates

### Code Quality Improvements

- Added proper error types instead of NSError
- Implemented structured logging instead of print statements
- Created protocol abstractions for better testability
- Migrated to async/await for cleaner async code
- Added comprehensive documentation

### Files Modified/Created

#### Created Files:
- `/src_docs/` - Complete documentation structure
- `RecordingProtocols.swift` - Protocol definitions
- `*+Protocol.swift` files - Protocol conformances
- `MockRecordingService.swift` - Test mocks
- `RecordingServiceTests.swift` - Protocol-based tests
- `SCStreamFrameOutput+Async.swift` - Async frame handling
- `Logger.swift` - Logging infrastructure
- `Errors.swift` - Error types
- `RecordingManager+Singleton.swift` - Singleton implementation

#### Modified Files:
- `.gitignore` - Added documentation build outputs
- Various existing files updated with new imports

### Outstanding Questions

1. Should we make manager initializers private to enforce singleton pattern?
2. Should we migrate all print statements to use the new logger?
3. Should we create a dependency injection container for better testability?

### Notes

- Documentation is ready to be built with `./build-docs.sh`
- All new code follows Swift best practices and modern patterns
- Backward compatibility maintained where possible
- Focus on testability and maintainability
