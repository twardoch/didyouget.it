Okay, I'll start by addressing the issues listed in your `TODO.md` file.

First, I'll try to understand where the recording logic and UI updates are handled. I'll search the codebase for files that might be related to "RecordingManager", "button", and "timer" to get an idea of the relevant parts of the application.

The search results point to `RecordingManager.swift` and `ContentView.swift` as the main files handling recording logic and UI. `PROGRESS.md` also contains information about previous attempts to fix similar issues.

Let's break down the issues from `TODO.md`:

1.  **Record button not working after stopping:**
    *   The `PROGRESS.md` file mentions that a "comprehensive state reset system" was implemented. It seems like the `forceFullReset()` method in `RecordingManager.swift` and the Stop button's action in `ContentView.swift` are intended to handle this. I need to check if these are working correctly.
2.  **Timer not ticking:**
    *   `RecordingManager.swift` has a `timerPublisher` and logic for a `dispatchTimer`. `ContentView.swift` uses `onReceive(recordingManager.timerPublisher)` to update the timer display. I'll investigate why this might not be updating.
3.  **JSONs are just `[]`:**
    *   `RecordingManager.swift` initializes `MouseTracker` and `KeyboardTracker`. The `startInputTracking()` and `stopInputTracking()` methods control them. I'll need to see if these are called correctly and if the data is being written to the files.
4.  **MOV is 11 bytes:**
    *   This suggests an issue with video processing or file writing. `RecordingManager.swift` uses `VideoProcessor` and `AudioProcessor`. The `handleSampleBuffer` method is crucial here, as is the `finishWriting` method in the processors.

I'll start by examining the `forceFullReset()` method and how it's called when the "Stop" button is pressed. I'll read the relevant parts of `RecordingManager.swift` and `ContentView.swift`.

It appears the `forceFullReset()` method in `RecordingManager.swift` is quite thorough. In `ContentView.swift`, when the Stop button is tapped:
1. `recordingManager.isRecording` is set to `false` immediately.
2. `recordingManager.forceFullReset()` is called.
3. `recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()` is called to update the UI.
4. An async `Task` calls `recordingManager.stopRecording()`.

The `stopRecording()` method in `RecordingManager.swift` calls `stopRecordingAsync()`, which then calls `forceFullReset()` again, both at the beginning of its `do` block and in its `catch` block.

This looks like a reasonable approach to resetting the state. The problem might be that `startRecordingAsync()` doesn't properly re-initialize everything needed after a `forceFullReset()`.

Let's examine `startRecordingAsync()` in `RecordingManager.swift` to see if it correctly sets up everything needed for a new recording, particularly the `isRecording` flag and the timer.

---

Read file: DidYouGet/DidYouGet/Models/RecordingManager.swift

---

In `startRecordingAsync()`:
- It calls `await resetRecordingState()` at the very beginning.
- It sets `isRecording = true` (line 252) *before* setting up the capture session and stream.
- It then configures and starts the `DispatchSourceTimer` (lines 325-387).

One potential issue: `resetRecordingState()` is called at the start of `startRecordingAsync()`. This `resetRecordingState` function calls `timer.invalidate()` and `self.timer = nil`. However, `forceFullReset` also invalidates `self.timer` and `self.dispatchTimer`.

It's possible that the `dispatchTimer` (which is the one responsible for updating `recordingDuration`) isn't being correctly re-initialized or that `isRecording` is not in the correct state when the timer event handler fires.

Let's look at the timer creation logic in `startRecordingAsync` (lines 325-387 of `RecordingManager.swift`) and the event handler (lines 360-380).

The `DispatchSourceTimer` is created and its event handler is set. The event handler checks `self.isRecording` and `!self.isPaused` before updating `recordingDuration`.
The `isRecording` flag is set to `true` at line 252 *before* the timer is created. This seems correct.

A subtle issue might be in `ContentView.swift`'s stop button action:
```swift
// CRITICAL FIX: Set isRecording to false IMMEDIATELY to update UI
// This forces UI to switch from Stop to Record button right away
recordingManager.isRecording = false // Line 93

// Force complete reset of recording state to allow immediate restart
recordingManager.forceFullReset() // Line 96

// ...
// Now actually stop recording in the background
Task(priority: .userInitiated) { // Line 103
    print("Executing actual stop operation asynchronously")
    
    // Only stop if we were actually recording
    if wasRecording { // wasRecording is a local copy
        await recordingManager.stopRecording() // This calls stopRecordingAsync
    }
}
```
1.  `isRecording` is set to `false` immediately in `ContentView`.
2.  `forceFullReset()` is called, which also sets `isRecording = false` and cancels `dispatchTimer`.
3.  Then, `stopRecording()` is called asynchronously, which calls `stopRecordingAsync()`.
4.  `stopRecordingAsync()` has a guard: `guard isRecording else { print("Not recording, ignoring stop request"); return }`.

Since `isRecording` was already set to `false` (twice, in fact, by `ContentView` and `forceFullReset`), the `stopRecordingAsync()` will immediately return. This means `mouseTracker.stopTracking()`, `keyboardTracker.stopTracking()`, and `videoProcessor.finishWriting()` might not be called consistently if `isRecording` is already false when `stopRecordingAsync` is entered.

This could explain both the "Record button not working after stopping" (if some state isn't fully cleaned up by the premature exit of `stopRecordingAsync`) and the "JSONs are empty" and "MOV is 11 bytes" issues (if trackers and writers aren't properly stopped/finalized).

The timer issue ("timer does not tick") could also be related if the `isRecording` flag is not correctly managed across these state changes, preventing the timer's event handler from updating `recordingDuration`.

**Proposed Plan:**

1.  **Modify `ContentView.swift` (Stop Button):**
    *   Remove the immediate `recordingManager.isRecording = false` (line 93).
    *   Remove the direct call to `recordingManager.forceFullReset()` (line 96).
    *   The `stopRecording()` call in the `Task` should be sufficient to handle state changes and resets through `stopRecordingAsync()` and the `forceFullReset()` it calls. The UI should update reactively based on the `@Published var isRecording` in `RecordingManager`.

2.  **Verify `RecordingManager.swift` (`stopRecordingAsync` and `forceFullReset`):**
    *   Ensure that `stopRecordingAsync` correctly sets `isRecording = false` at the appropriate time (it already does this at line 532).
    *   Ensure that `forceFullReset` is called reliably at the end of `stopRecording` (it already is).

3.  **Verify `RecordingManager.swift` (`startRecordingAsync`):**
    *   The call to `await resetRecordingState()` at the beginning of `startRecordingAsync` (line 179) should ensure a clean state.
    *   Ensure `isRecording` is set to `true` (line 252) *before* the `DispatchSourceTimer` is set up and started (lines 350-387). This seems to be the case.

Let's start by modifying `ContentView.swift`.

I will make the following changes to `DidYouGet/DidYouGet/Views/ContentView.swift`:
*   Remove `recordingManager.isRecording = false` (line 93).
*   Remove `recordingManager.forceFullReset()` (line 96).

+                                 recordingManager.objectWillChange.send() // Notify UI to expect changes
                              }
                              
```

The diff shows that lines 93 and 96 were commented out, and a print statement was updated. This is not quite what I intended. I wanted to remove the lines, not comment them out.
The `print` statement on line 88 was changed, which is fine.
The `withAnimation` block on lines 99-101 was also modified slightly, which is also fine.

I'll try to re-apply the edit, making it clearer that the lines should be deleted.

                              let wasRecording = recordingManager.isRecording
                              
-                             // Force UI refresh immediately with animation for better visual feedback
-                             // The actual state change will come from RecordingManager

                              withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2)) {

+                                 recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()
                              }
                              
```

The re-application of the edit didn't achieve the desired outcome. It seems the model is struggling to remove the specific lines. I will try a more targeted approach by providing the exact lines to keep and using `// ... existing code ...` for the parts I want to remove.

This is the original relevant section in `ContentView.swift`:
```swift
// ...
                        // Stop button with direct state handling
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Stop button clicked - immediate UI update + background stop") // Line 88
                            
                            // Make a local copy of the current recording state
                            let wasRecording = recordingManager.isRecording // Line 91
                            
                            // CRITICAL FIX: Set isRecording to false IMMEDIATELY to update UI
                            // This forces UI to switch from Stop to Record button right away
                            recordingManager.isRecording = false // Line 93 - TO REMOVE
                            
                            // Force complete reset of recording state to allow immediate restart
                            recordingManager.forceFullReset() // Line 96 - TO REMOVE
                            
                            // Force UI refresh immediately with animation for better visual feedback
                            withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2)) { // Line 99
                                recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()
                            }
                            
                            // Now actually stop recording in the background
                            Task(priority: .userInitiated) { // Line 103
// ...
```

I want it to become:
```swift
// ...
                        // Stop button with direct state handling
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Stop button clicked - deferring state changes to RecordingManager") // Updated print
                            
                            // Make a local copy of the current recording state
                            let wasRecording = recordingManager.isRecording
                                                        
                            // Notify UI to expect changes from RecordingManager
                            withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2)) {
                                recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()
                            }
                            
                            // Now actually stop recording in the background
                            Task(priority: .userInitiated) {
// ...
```

I will attempt the edit again with this precise structure.

The edit was not applied. It seems the model is having trouble with this specific change.

Let's try a different approach. I will modify `RecordingManager.swift` first.
The issue might be that `stopRecordingAsync()` exits early if `isRecording` is already `false`.
If `ContentView` sets `isRecording = false` immediately, and then calls `stopRecording()` which in turn calls `stopRecordingAsync()`, the `guard isRecording else { return }` in `stopRecordingAsync()` (line 529) would cause it to exit.

Let's modify `stopRecordingAsync` in `RecordingManager.swift`.
Instead of `guard isRecording else { return }`, I'll store the `isRecording` state at the beginning of the function, set `self.isRecording = false` (to ensure UI updates and prevent multiple stop calls), and then proceed with the cleanup logic regardless of the initial `isRecording` state *if* there's an indication that a recording was in progress (e.g., `startTime != nil` or `videoOutputURL != nil`).

A simpler change for now: what if `stopRecording()` itself sets `isRecording = false` *before* calling `stopRecordingAsync()`?
Currently, `stopRecording()` is:
```swift
    @MainActor
    func stopRecording() async {
        print("Stop recording requested")
        do {
            try await stopRecordingAsync() // isRecording is checked inside here
            print("Stop recording complete - ensuring full state reset")
            forceFullReset()
            // ... UI update
        } catch {
            // ... error handling ...
            forceFullReset()
        }
    }
```
And `stopRecordingAsync()` starts with:
```swift
    @MainActor
    func stopRecordingAsync() async throws {
        guard isRecording else { // This is the guard causing issues
            print("Not recording, ignoring stop request")
            return 
        }
        // ... rest of the function
        print("Setting isRecording = false") // Line 532
        isRecording = false
        // ...
    }
```
The problem is that `ContentView` already sets `isRecording = false` and calls `forceFullReset()` *before* `stopRecording()` is even entered from the async Task.

Let's revert to the idea of changing `ContentView.swift` and be very explicit.
I will specify the lines I want to keep and use `// ... removed lines ...` for the code I want to delete.

Original `ContentView.swift` around lines 87-103:
```swift
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Stop button clicked - immediate UI update + background stop") // 88
                            
                            let wasRecording = recordingManager.isRecording // 91
                            
                            recordingManager.isRecording = false // 93 (REMOVE)
                            
                            recordingManager.forceFullReset() // 96 (REMOVE)
                            
                            withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2)) { // 99
                                recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()
                            }
                            
                            Task(priority: .userInitiated) { // 103
                                print("Executing actual stop operation asynchronously")
                                if wasRecording {
                                    await recordingManager.stopRecording()
                                    // ...
                                }
                            }
                        }) {
```

Desired state:
```swift
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Stop button clicked - deferring state changes to RecordingManager") // MODIFIED
                            
                            let wasRecording = recordingManager.isRecording // KEPT
                            
                            // ... removed lines ... // Placeholder for lines 93 & 96
                            
                            withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2)) { // KEPT
                                recordingManager.objectWillChange.send() // This will signal UI to expect change
                            }
                            
                            Task(priority: .userInitiated) { // KEPT
                                print("Executing actual stop operation asynchronously")
                                if wasRecording { // Important to use the local 'wasRecording'
                                    await recordingManager.stopRecording()
                                    // ...
                                }
                            }
                        }) {
```
I'll try editing `ContentView.swift` again with this more explicit instruction.

---



---

It seems the edit tool is consistently failing to apply these specific changes to `ContentView.swift`. I'll have to try a different strategy.

Let's focus on `RecordingManager.swift`. The core problem is that `stopRecordingAsync()` might not run its full cleanup if `isRecording` is already `false` when it's called.

Current `stopRecordingAsync` (lines 526-594):
```swift
    @MainActor
    func stopRecordingAsync() async throws {
        guard isRecording else { // Problematic guard
            print("Not recording, ignoring stop request")
            return 
        }
        
        print("\\n=== STOPPING RECORDING ===\\n")
        
        print("Setting isRecording = false")
        isRecording = false // This should be one of the first things
        
        print("Setting isPaused = false")
        isPaused = false
        
        // ... timer invalidation ...
        // ... input tracking stop ...
        // ... capture session stop ...
        // ... finalize writers ...
        // ... etc. ...
    }
```

And `stopRecording` (lines 499-524):
```swift
    @MainActor
    func stopRecording() async {
        print("Stop recording requested")
        do {
            try await stopRecordingAsync() // Calls the above
            
            print("Stop recording complete - ensuring full state reset")
            forceFullReset() // Resets everything, including isRecording = false
            
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                self.objectWillChange.send()
            }
        } catch {
            print("Error in stopRecording: \\(error)")
            print("Error stopping recording - forcing full reset anyway")
            forceFullReset() // Also resets everything
        }
    }
```

If `ContentView` *does* set `isRecording = false` and calls `forceFullReset()` before `stopRecording()` is even entered by the `Task`, then:
1. `isRecording` is `false`.
2. `dispatchTimer` is `nil` (due to `forceFullReset`).
3. `mouseTracker` and `keyboardTracker` might still be active if `forceFullReset` doesn't stop them (it doesn't look like it does, it just clears URLs).
4. `videoProcessor` and `audioProcessor` might not have `finishWriting` called.

The `forceFullReset()` method (lines 683-731) does:
- `isRecording = false`, `isPaused = false`, `recordingDuration = 0`
- Kills timers (`timer` and `dispatchTimer`)
- Clears URLs
- `startTime = nil`
- Clears UserDefaults

It *doesn't* call:
- `mouseTracker.stopTracking()`
- `keyboardTracker.stopTracking()`
- `captureSessionManager.stopCapture()`
- `videoProcessor.finishWriting()`
- `audioProcessor.finishWriting()`

These are all in `stopRecordingAsync()`. If `stopRecordingAsync()` is skipped because `isRecording` is already false (due to `ContentView`'s direct modification or the `forceFullReset` call from `ContentView`), then these crucial cleanup steps are missed. This is the most likely cause for all four issues in `TODO.md`.

**Revised Plan:**

1.  **Modify `RecordingManager.swift` - `stopRecording()` function:**
    *   This function should be the single point of entry for initiating a stop.
    *   It should first capture the current recording state (e.g., `let oldIsRecording = self.isRecording`).
    *   Then, it should *unconditionally* call `stopRecordingAsyncInternal()` (a new helper function containing the current logic of `stopRecordingAsync`).
    *   After `stopRecordingAsyncInternal` completes (or throws an error), `forceFullReset()` should be called.
    *   This ensures that the cleanup logic in `stopRecordingAsyncInternal` *always* runs if a recording was active, and `forceFullReset` *always* runs to clean up anything remaining.

2.  **Create `RecordingManager.swift` - `stopRecordingAsyncInternal()` function:**
    *   This new private function will contain the body of the current `stopRecordingAsync()`.
    *   It will *not* have the `guard isRecording else { return }` check at the beginning. It will assume it's being called because a stop is necessary.
    *   It will perform all the crucial cleanup: stopping trackers, stopping capture, finalizing writers.
    *   It will set `isRecording = false`, `isPaused = false`, `recordingDuration = 0` as it does now.

3.  **Modify `ContentView.swift` (Stop Button Action):**
    *   The Stop button action should *only* do one thing: `Task { await recordingManager.stopRecording() }`.
    *   It should *not* set `isRecording = false` itself.
    *   It should *not* call `forceFullReset()` itself.
    *   It can keep the `let wasRecording = recordingManager.isRecording` and the `if wasRecording` around the Task that calls `stopRecording`, or the `stopRecording` method itself can handle the "was it actually recording?" check. For simplicity and to ensure `stopRecording` is always the decider, we can remove the `if wasRecording` in `ContentView`.

This approach centralizes the stop logic and state management within `RecordingManager`.

Let's start by refactoring `RecordingManager.swift`.

I'll create `stopRecordingAsyncInternal()` and modify `stopRecording()` and the original `stopRecordingAsync()`.
The original `stopRecordingAsync` will become the new `stopRecordingAsyncInternal`.
The new `stopRecording` will call `stopRecordingAsyncInternal` and then `forceFullReset`.
The existing `stopRecording` function will be replaced.

This refactoring in `RecordingManager.swift` seems to have been applied correctly.
`stopRecordingAsync` was renamed to `stopRecordingAsyncInternal` and made private.
The new `stopRecording` function now calls `stopRecordingAsyncInternal` and then `forceFullReset`.
`stopRecordingAsyncInternal` has a new guard at the beginning to check for actual recording activity (`startTime != nil || videoOutputURL != nil || ...`) before proceeding with extensive cleanup. This is good because `forceFullReset` (which is called by `stopRecording`) already clears these.

Now, I need to modify `ContentView.swift` to simplify its Stop button action.
It should just call `await recordingManager.stopRecording()`.

Original relevant section in `ContentView.swift` (lines 87-120):
```swift
                        // Stop button with direct state handling
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Stop button clicked - immediate UI update + background stop")
                            
                            // Make a local copy of the current recording state
                            let wasRecording = recordingManager.isRecording
                            
                            // CRITICAL FIX: Set isRecording to false IMMEDIATELY to update UI
                            // This forces UI to switch from Stop to Record button right away
                            recordingManager.isRecording = false // THIS WAS THE LINE TO REMOVE
                            
                            // Force complete reset of recording state to allow immediate restart
                            recordingManager.forceFullReset() // THIS WAS THE LINE TO REMOVE
                            
                            // Force UI refresh immediately with animation for better visual feedback
                            withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2)) {
                                recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()
                            }
                            
                            // Now actually stop recording in the background
                            Task(priority: .userInitiated) {
                                print("Executing actual stop operation asynchronously")
                                
                                // Only stop if we were actually recording
                                if wasRecording { // This if can also be removed if stopRecording handles it
                                    await recordingManager.stopRecording()
                                    
                                    // Force another UI update after actual stopping
                                    await MainActor.run {
                                        print("Final UI update after recording stop completed")
                                        withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.2)) {
                                            recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()
                                        }
                                    }
                                }
                            }
                        }) {
```

I will change it to:
```swift
                        // Stop button with direct state handling
                        Button(action: {
                            print("Stop button clicked - requesting stop via RecordingManager")
                            
                            // The RecordingManager.stopRecording() will handle all state changes
                            // and UI updates via its @Published properties.
                            Task(priority: .userInitiated) {
                                await recordingManager.stopRecording()
                            }
                        }) {
```
This simplifies `ContentView` significantly and centralizes all stop logic in `RecordingManager`.
The `recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()` calls from `ContentView` are no longer needed, as `RecordingManager`'s `@Published` properties and its `forceFullReset` (which also sends `objectWillChange`) will handle UI updates.

This change to `ContentView.swift` looks correct and significantly simplifies the stop button logic.

Now, let's consider the implications:

1.  **Record button not working after stopping:**
    *   This should be fixed. `RecordingManager.stopRecording()` now ensures `stopRecordingAsyncInternal` (which does the detailed cleanup like stopping trackers and finalizing files) is called, followed by `forceFullReset` (which resets all state variables and timers). `startRecordingAsync` calls `resetRecordingState` at its beginning, further ensuring a clean slate.

2.  **Timer not ticking:**
    *   When `startRecordingAsync` is called, it sets up a `DispatchSourceTimer`. This timer's handler updates `recordingDuration` only if `self.isRecording` is true.
    *   `isRecording` is set to `true` in `startRecordingAsync` *before* the timer is created.
    *   When `stopRecordingAsyncInternal` runs, it sets `isRecording = false` and cancels the `dispatchTimer`.
    *   `forceFullReset` also cancels `dispatchTimer` and sets `isRecording = false`.
    *   This logic seems sound for the timer. If the timer is still not ticking, it might be an issue with how `ContentView` observes `recordingDuration` or `timerPublisher`, or a more subtle problem in the timer setup itself within `startRecordingAsync`. The current setup uses `DispatchSource.makeTimerSource` which is generally reliable. The `onReceive(recordingManager.timerPublisher)` in `ContentView` might be redundant if `recordingDuration` is a `@Published` property that drives the UI. Line 19 in `ContentView` (`.onReceive(recordingManager.timerPublisher)`) explicitly calls `recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()`. This might conflict with or be made unnecessary by the `@Published var recordingDuration` automatically triggering UI updates.

3.  **JSONs are just `[]` & MOV is 11 bytes:**
    *   These issues were likely due to `stopRecordingAsyncInternal` (previously `stopRecordingAsync`) being skipped, so `mouseTracker.stopTracking()`, `keyboardTracker.stopTracking()`, and `videoProcessor.finishWriting()` were not called.
    *   With the new structure, `stopRecordingAsyncInternal` should always execute its cleanup if there was recording activity, including stopping trackers and finalizing files. This should resolve these issues.

Let's look at the timer display in `ContentView.swift`:
```swift
// ContentView.swift
// ...
                    if recordingManager.isRecording {
                        Text(timeString(from: recordingManager.recordingDuration)) // Line 15
                            .font(.system(.title3, design: .monospaced))
                            .foregroundColor(.primary)
                            .id("timer-\\(Int(recordingManager.recordingDuration))") // Force refresh with changing ID
                            .onReceive(recordingManager.timerPublisher) { _ in // Line 19
                                // This creates a timer dependency in the SwiftUI view
                                withAnimation {
                                    // Force UI refresh on timer tick
                                    recordingManager.objectWillChange.send() // Line 23
                                }
                            }
// ...
```
`recordingManager.recordingDuration` is a `@Published` property. SwiftUI should automatically update `Text(timeString(from: recordingManager.recordingDuration))` when `recordingDuration` changes. The `.id(...)` modifier is a way to force view updates, but the `onReceive` block calling `objectWillChange.send()` might be an older way to ensure updates when `timerPublisher` was the primary mechanism.

`RecordingManager.swift` has:
```swift
    @Published var recordingDuration: TimeInterval = 0 // Line 28
    let timerPublisher = Timer.publish(every: 0.1, on: .main, in: .common).autoconnect() // Line 31
    // ...
    // DispatchSourceTimer event handler:
    timerSource.setEventHandler { [weak self] in // Line 360
        // ...
        if self.recordingDuration != newDuration {
            self.recordingDuration = newDuration // This @Published property updates the UI
        // ...
        }
    }
```
Since `recordingDuration` is `@Published`, the `onReceive(recordingManager.timerPublisher)` and the explicit `recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()` in `ContentView` (line 23) are likely redundant and could potentially cause issues or just be unnecessary. The `timerPublisher` itself (a `Timer.publish` stream) is also not directly used by the `DispatchSourceTimer` that actually updates `recordingDuration`. The `DispatchSourceTimer` is the one doing the work.

**Suggestion for timer issue:**
In `ContentView.swift`, remove the `.onReceive(recordingManager.timerPublisher)` modifier and its block (lines 19-25). The UI should update based on changes to the `@Published var recordingDuration` directly.

Let's apply this change to `ContentView.swift`.

The removal of the `.onReceive` block in `ContentView.swift` was successful.

At this point, the major structural changes to the stop/start logic and timer display are complete. These changes should address all four points in `TODO.md`.

To summarize the key changes:
1.  **Centralized Stop Logic:** `RecordingManager.stopRecording()` is now the sole initiator of the stop sequence. It calls an internal method (`stopRecordingAsyncInternal`) to perform all cleanup (stopping trackers, finalizing files) and then calls `forceFullReset()` to reset all states and timers. This ensures cleanup and reset happen consistently.
2.  **Simplified `ContentView`:** The Stop button in `ContentView.swift` now only calls `recordingManager.stopRecording()`. It no longer directly manipulates state or calls reset functions.
3.  **Timer Display:** The timer display in `ContentView.swift` now relies solely on the `@Published var recordingDuration` property in `RecordingManager`. The redundant `timerPublisher` and explicit `objectWillChange.send()` calls related to it have been removed from the view.

These changes should make the recording lifecycle more robust.

I will now update `TODO.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

The `TODO.md` update needs a bit of reformatting. I want to replace the old issues with a comment saying they've been addressed by the refactoring.

  ### Added
```

The `CHANGELOG.md` and `TODO.md` files have been updated. The core code changes in `RecordingManager.swift` and `ContentView.swift` should address the issues outlined.

The next step would be to build and run the application (`./run.sh`) to test these changes and observe the console output for any new issues or remaining problems. Since I cannot do that, I have completed the requested fixes based on the code analysis.The issues from your `TODO.md` should now be addressed. I've refactored the recording start and stop logic to be more robust, which should resolve the problems with the Record button, the timer, and the empty output files.

Here's a summary of the key changes:

1.  **Centralized Recording Stop Logic in `RecordingManager.swift`**:
    *   The `stopRecording()` method is now the single point of entry for stopping a recording.
    *   It calls a new private method, `stopRecordingAsyncInternal()`, which contains the core cleanup logic (stopping input trackers, stopping the capture session, finalizing video/audio files). This internal method is designed to run its full course if there was any recording activity.
    *   After `stopRecordingAsyncInternal()` completes (or if it errors), `forceFullReset()` is now reliably called to ensure all state variables, timers, and URLs are cleared, preparing the app for a new recording.
    *   This change aims to prevent scenarios where cleanup was skipped, leading to empty files or an unresponsive UI.

2.  **Simplified Stop Button in `ContentView.swift`**:
    *   The action for the "Stop" button has been significantly simplified. It now only creates an asynchronous `Task` that calls `await recordingManager.stopRecording()`.
    *   All direct state manipulation (like setting `isRecording = false` or calling `forceFullReset()`) has been removed from `ContentView`. The view now relies entirely on the `RecordingManager` to manage state and trigger UI updates through its `@Published` properties.

3.  **Timer Display Fix in `ContentView.swift`**:
    *   The `Text` view that displays the recording duration now relies solely on the `@Published var recordingDuration` property from the `RecordingManager`.
    *   The previous `.onReceive(recordingManager.timerPublisher)` modifier, which contained an explicit call to `recordingManager.objectWillChange.send()`, has been removed as it was redundant and potentially conflicting with the standard SwiftUI data flow for `@Published` properties. The `DispatchSourceTimer` in `RecordingManager` directly updates `recordingDuration`, which automatically refreshes the UI.

I've updated `TODO.md` to reflect that these issues are believed to be fixed and added a corresponding entry to `CHANGELOG.md`.

You should now be able to build and run the application using `./run.sh` to test these changes. Please observe the console output for any new issues.
