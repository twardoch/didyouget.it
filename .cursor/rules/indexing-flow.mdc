## File Processing Pipeline

The recording system processes different data streams in parallel tracks that must be synchronized:

1. Visual Stream
- Screen capture frames from selected display/window/area
- Metadata including frame timestamps and resolution
- Located in: `DidYouGet/DidYouGet/Models/Recording/VideoProcessor.swift`

2. Input Event Stream
- Mouse events (clicks, movements, drags)
- Keyboard events (taps, holds, releases)
- Located in:
  - `DidYouGet/DidYouGet/Models/InputTracking/MouseTracker.swift`
  - `DidYouGet/DidYouGet/Models/InputTracking/KeyboardTracker.swift`

3. Audio Stream (Optional)
- Raw audio buffer data
- Audio device metadata
- Located in: `DidYouGet/DidYouGet/Models/Recording/AudioProcessor.swift`

## Inclusion Rules

Files are processed based on the following decision tree:

1. Recording Session Files
- Include if associated with active recording session
- Must contain valid timestamp data
- Must match selected capture mode (full/window/area)

2. Input Tracking Files
- Include if input tracking is enabled in preferences
- Must contain valid event sequence data
- Must maintain temporal alignment with video stream

3. Audio Files
- Include only if audio recording is enabled
- Must have valid device selection
- Must maintain sync with video timeline

## Reference Resolution

The system maintains three types of references:

1. Temporal References
- Frame timestamps for video stream
- Event timestamps for input tracking
- Sample timestamps for audio

2. Resource References
- Display/window identifiers
- Audio device identifiers
- Output file paths

3. State References
- Recording session status
- Input tracking enablement
- Audio mixing configuration

Importance Score: 85 (Key integration point for coordinating multiple data streams)
