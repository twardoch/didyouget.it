# indexing-flow

The project's indexing system operates on two primary levels:

1. Recording Asset Indexing
- Creates uniquely identified recording sessions using timestamp-based naming (DidYouGet_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS)
- Maintains catalog of screen recordings with associated metadata
- Tracks recording configurations per session

Importance Score: 85

2. Input Source Management
Files processed:
- PreferencesManager.swift: Input device registration and configuration tracking
- RecordingManager.swift: Active source monitoring and state management

Indexing behaviors:
- Monitors active input sources (display, audio, keyboard, mouse)
- Maintains reference mapping between capture sources and output streams
- Filters input based on user-defined tracking policies

Importance Score: 75

3. Exclusion Patterns
Defined in `.cursorindexingignore`:
- Prevents indexing of temporary recording buffers
- Excludes system-specific capture artifacts
- Filters development and build artifacts

Importance Score: 45
