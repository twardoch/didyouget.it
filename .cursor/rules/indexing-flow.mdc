# indexing-flow

The indexing system processes files according to a hierarchical set of rules and patterns:

## File Selection Logic (70)
Main indexing configuration is split across two files:
- `.cursorignore` - Global exclusion patterns
- `.cursorindexingignore` - Project-specific indexing rules

Files are processed in the following order:
1. Apply global ignore patterns
2. Check project-specific ignore rules
3. Process remaining files through the build system

## Build Integration (65)
The Makefile coordinates indexing integration with the build process:
1. Pre-build indexing scan
2. Build artifact tracking
3. Post-build index updates for generated files

## Reference Resolution (60)
Reference handling follows a specific path:
1. Local file references within the project structure
2. External package references (via Package.swift)
3. System framework linkages

The system maintains separation between source indexing and build artifact indexing to prevent contamination between the two contexts.
