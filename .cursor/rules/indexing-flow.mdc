# indexing-flow

The indexing system follows these core business rules:

## Exclusion Patterns
- `.cursorignore` defines global exclusion patterns 
- `.cursorindexingignore` specifies additional indexing-specific exclusions
- Build artifacts and temporary recording files are excluded from indexing

## File Processing Flow
1. Screen Recording Assets:
   - Video frames are processed in real-time at 60 FPS
   - Retina resolution captures are indexed separately from standard resolution
   - Audio streams are indexed with timestamp correlation to video frames

2. Input Tracking Data:
   - Mouse events are indexed in JSON format with categorized interactions
   - Keyboard events are indexed with privacy filtering for sensitive input
   - Input timing data is synchronized with video frame indexes

3. Session Management:
   - Recording sessions create uniquely indexed containers
   - Multiple streams (video, audio, input) are cross-referenced by timestamps
   - Paused sessions maintain index continuity
