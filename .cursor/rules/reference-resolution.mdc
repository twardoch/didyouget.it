# reference-resolution

The specification does not contain detailed information about a reference resolution system or @ syntax-based content inclusions. The provided technical details focus on recording functionality, input tracking, and audio/video processing without mentioning reference resolution mechanisms.

Based on the available files and structure, there is no explicit reference system implementation documented in the core components:

- RecordingManager.swift
- InputTracking/
- Recording/
- Models/

While the project contains logic for coordinating multiple data streams (video, audio, input events), there is no indication of a reference-based inclusion or resolution system.

Importance Score: 0 (No reference resolution system documented in the specification)
