# reference-resolution

Based on the provided specification, there is no explicit implementation or documentation of a reference resolution system or @ references. The specification appears to focus on screen recording, input tracking, and media capture functionality without mentioning any reference management or linking capabilities.

The project structure includes:

- Documentation files (README.md, SPEC.md, PROGRESS.md, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md)
- Source code organization
- Build configuration

However, there is no indication of:
- Link management systems
- Cross-reference handling
- Content resolution mechanisms
- Context-aware inclusion processing

The specification focuses entirely on recording functionality and does not cover reference resolution aspects of the application.
