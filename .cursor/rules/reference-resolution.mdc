# reference-resolution

Based on the provided specification, there is a basic reference resolution system in place for screen recordings:

Core Reference Components:

1. Session Reference Tracking:
- Each recording session generates a unique identifier 
- Uses timestamp-based references in format: DidYouGet_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS
- Recording Manager maintains contextual links between active captures and reference IDs

2. Input Source References:
- Maps device references to corresponding input streams
- Associates audio input channels with specific recording sessions
- Links mouse/keyboard capture events to their parent recording context

Importance Scores:
- Session Reference Management: 85 - Critical for maintaining recording context
- Input Reference Resolution: 75 - Essential for input source mapping
- Timestamp Reference System: 65 - Supports unique identification
