# reference-resolution

The reference resolution system implements selective content inclusion through @ references within the indexing system. This allows for granular control over what content gets indexed, even when it exists within excluded directories.

### Core Reference Resolution Logic
- Processes @ references to include specific contexts
- Overrides general exclusion rules in `.cursorindexingignore`
- Enables contextual inclusion of otherwise excluded content

### Implementation Details
File: `.cursorindexingignore`
```
Importance Score: 85 - Critical for contextual content management
```

The reference system enables:
1. Context-specific inclusions within excluded directories
2. Selective override of general exclusion rules
3. Granular control over indexed content through @ mentions

### Integration Points
- Works in conjunction with the `.specstory/` directory exclusion rule
- Provides exceptions to the auto-save file exclusion mechanism
- Enables targeted indexing of specific contexts

### Business Impact
- Maintains efficient indexing while allowing specific content inclusion
- Supports context-aware document management
- Enables flexible content accessibility within excluded directories
