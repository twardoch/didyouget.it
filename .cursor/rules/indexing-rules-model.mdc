- Specify input types that should not be tracked (e.g., password fields)
- Importance Score: 85

Input Event Indexing Structure:
- Keyboard events indexed by:
  - Event type (tap, hold, release)
  - Timestamp (ms precision)
  - Key combination state
  - Modifier flags

- Mouse events indexed by:
  - Movement coordinates
  - Event type (click, drag, release)
  - Button state
  - Duration for hold events
