# indexing-rules-model

The indexing rules model implements the file organization and pattern matching system for recorded video content.

Core Indexing Components:

1. Recording Output Pattern Structure:
- Enforces "DidYouGet_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS" naming convention
- Groups recordings by capture mode (full display/window/area)
- Maintains metadata association between recordings and preferences

2. Video Organization Rules:
- Organizes recordings based on quality tier categories 
- Auto-categorizes files by input type (screen-only vs screen+audio)
- Maintains temporal grouping of related recording segments

Business Rule Importance Scores:

90 - Recording naming pattern enforcement
85 - Quality-based categorization
75 - Input type organization
70 - Temporal grouping rules

Relevant Files:
- `DidYouGet/DidYouGet/Models/RecordingManager.swift`
- `DidYouGet/DidYouGet/Models/PreferencesManager.swift`
