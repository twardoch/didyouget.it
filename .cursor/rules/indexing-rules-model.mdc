# indexing-rules-model

The indexing rules model specifies file organization patterns relevant to the screen recording functionality:

Recording Data Organization:
- Screen capture streams indexed by display identifier
- Input tracking files organized by session timestamps
- Audio capture streams cataloged by device ID

File Structure Rules:
Separate indexing for:
- Video recording segments
- Mouse/keyboard event logs in JSON format
- Audio stream components
- Mixed media output files

Format Rules:
1. Screen Recording Index
- Resolution and FPS metadata
- Display identifier mapping
- Capture area coordinates

2. Input Tracking Index
- Mouse event categorization (click/hold/drag)
- Keyboard event classification (tap/hold)
- Timestamp-based correlation

3. Audio Stream Index
- Device mapping
- Stream synchronization markers
- Mixed vs. separate output flags

Importance Scores:
- Recording Data Organization: 85 (Key integration structure)
- Format Rules: 75 (Critical for data correlation)
- File Structure Rules: 65 (Supporting organization)
