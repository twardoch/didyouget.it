# indexing-rules-model

## Core Rule Structure
The indexing rules model implements selective content filtering through pattern-based exclusion rules with contextual override capabilities.

## Pattern Matching System
```
.specstory/**    # Directory-based exclusion
@references      # Contextual inclusion markers
```

Importance Score: 85 - Critical for content organization and indexing efficiency

## Rule Components

### Directory Exclusions
- Full directory path exclusion using `/**` syntax
- Targets specific tool-generated content (e.g., `.specstory/`)
- Prevents indexing of transient/auto-save files

### Context References
- Uses `@` prefix for explicit inclusion markers
- Overrides general exclusion rules
- Enables granular content selection

Importance Score: 80 - Essential for maintaining indexed content relevance

## Business Logic Implementation

### Selective Indexing Control
1. Primary exclusion rules prevent indexing of non-essential content
2. Context references allow specific content inclusion
3. Tool-specific directory targeting (.specstory)

### Workflow Integration
- Optimizes indexing by filtering auto-generated content
- Maintains searchability of explicitly referenced materials
- Supports development workflow with SpecStory integration

Importance Score: 90 - Direct impact on system efficiency and content organization
