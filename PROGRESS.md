   - Modified ContentView's onAppear behavior to check if recording is active before resetting state
   - Ensured recording continues properly when UI is hidden and then shown again

3. **Frame processing in SCStream handler** - Improved frame processing to ensure proper video capture

   - Improved task priority for frame processing to ensure real-time handling
   - Enhanced logging throughout the recording pipeline for better diagnostics

4. **Missing JSON files** - Enhanced input tracking initialization, file creation, and error handling
5. **File verification** - Added more robust checks to verify file existence and contents after recording
6. **Preferences handling** - Fixed issues where preferences weren't correctly accessed during recording 
7. **Recording state bug** - Fixed issue where recording state wasn't set after starting, causing timer and output files to fail

### Known Issues

- ~~FIXED: App UI freezes when clicking "Record"; the app becomes unresponsive and must be force quit.~~
- ~~FIXED: When clicking Record then Stop, the timer never starts and no MOV or JSON files are produced.~~
- ~~FIXED: Recording produces empty .mov files (0 bytes) even though the JSON files for mouse and keyboard tracking are created correctly~~
- ~~FIXED: Recording state isn't maintained when the app UI is closed and reopened (menu bar item remains)~~
- ~~FIXED: Timer does not start running after clicking Record~~
- ~~FIXED: Stop button does not change back to Record button after clicking Stop~~
- ~~FIXED: App creates empty folders with no files inside~~

1. Implement area selection tool for specific screen regions
2. Add audio level monitoring visualization
3. Implement mouse cursor overlay option
4. Add keyboard shortcuts for recording controls
5. Improve save location selector UI
6. Implement data synchronization with video timestamps
7. Add "high quality" toggle for lossless compression
8. Create privacy permission UI flow for smoother onboarding
