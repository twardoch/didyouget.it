I want a fast performant app `Did You Get It` (Mac identifier it.didyouget.mac, homepage https://didyouget.it ) that will run on macOS with extremely minimal user interface, and will let me: 

- Record the configurable area on the selectable screen, as a 60 FPS full-resolution (Retina) video
- If requested, record the audio from a selectable audio device
- If requested, record the mouse movements and clicks
- If requested, record the keyboard strokes in the WebVTT format
- Save the recorded video, audio, and mouse/keyboard strokes to a file. If requested, the audio should be mixed with the video.

Tasks: 

- Write a detailed specification in `SPEC.md`
- Write a detailed plan in `PROGRESS.md`, using `[ ]` items. 
- Configure the project in this repo so it can be built easily on macOS with a simple command. 
- Start implementing the plan. 
- As you work, revise the `PROGRESS.md` file to track your progress. 
- Write documentation of the project in `README.md`
- Write a `CHANGELOG.md` file for the project.
