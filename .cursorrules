# Project

I want a fast performant app `Did You Get It` (Mac identifier it.didyouget.mac, homepage https://didyouget.it ) that will run on macOS with extremely minimal user interface, and will let me: 

- Record the configurable area on the selectable screen, as a 60 FPS full-resolution (Retina) video
- If requested, record the audio from a selectable audio device
- If requested, record the mouse movements and clicks in JSON format with click vs. hold-release detection
- If requested, record the keyboard strokes in JSON format with tap vs. hold-release detection
- Save the recorded video, audio, and mouse/keyboard strokes to a file. If requested, the audio should be mixed with the video.

## Structure

- `README.md` contains the overview of the project
- `SPEC.md` contains the detailed specification. Check it, make sure you understand it, and then start working.
- `PROGRESS.md` contains the plan and uses `[ ]` vs. `[x]` items to track the progress. Keep it updated as you work.
- `CHANGELOG.md` contains the changelog. Keep updated as you work
- `TODO.md` contains the highest-priority issues that you have to prioritize. Keep updated as you work.

## Operation

As you work: 

- Consult TODO.md for highest-priority issues and fix them. Update the file as you work.
- Consult PROGRESS.md for additional issues and fix them. Update the file as you work.
- Keep the CHANGELOG.md updated as you work.
- After you make a change, perform `./run.sh debug` on macOS to build and run the app in debug mode, and observer the console output for any issues.

# main-overview

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


"Did You Get It" (didyouget.it) is a macOS screen recording system with synchronized input tracking and media capture capabilities.

Core Business Components:

1. Screen Recording Engine
- Configurable area capture with Retina resolution at 60 FPS
- Multi-display support with selective recording zones
- Full resolution capture with dynamic scaling

2. Input Tracking System
- Synchronized mouse tracking with movement paths
- Click vs. hold-release detection
- Keyboard event capture with modifier key support
- JSON-formatted input data with timing information

3. Audio Integration
- Selectable audio device recording
- Optional audio-video mixing capabilities
- Synchronized audio stream management

Key Business Files:
```
DidYouGet/Models/RecordingManager.swift     - Recording orchestration
DidYouGet/Models/InputTracking/*Tracker.swift - Input capture system
DidYouGet/Utilities/AudioManager.swift      - Audio processing
```

Business Workflows:

1. Recording Session:
- Area selection and validation
- Input device configuration
- Stream initialization and synchronization
- Multi-format data capture

2. Data Management:
- Synchronized timestamp management
- Input event categorization
- Media stream coordination
- Format-specific output generation

Importance Scores:
- Recording Engine: 95 (core business functionality)
- Input Tracking: 90 (unique interaction capture)
- Audio Integration: 85 (critical media component)
- Session Management: 80 (workflow orchestration)
