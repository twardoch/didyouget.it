## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements a selective indexing system focused on managing document processing within development workflows. The core functionality revolves around intelligent file exclusion and contextual inclusion mechanisms.

## Core Business Components

### Indexing Control System
**Importance Score: 85**

Located in `.cursorindexingignore`, this component manages the selective processing of documents with two primary functions:

1. Auto-save Management
- Excludes `.specstory/**` directory content
- Prevents processing of temporary development artifacts
- Optimizes index relevance by filtering transient content

2. Contextual Inclusion Framework
- Supports explicit context inclusion via `@` references
- Enables granular control over indexed content
- Allows exceptions to general exclusion rules

## Integration Points

### SpecStory Integration
**Importance Score: 75**

The indexing system specifically integrates with SpecStory workflows by:
- Recognizing SpecStory-generated auto-save patterns
- Maintaining clean indexes during document drafting
- Supporting development-time document management

### Context Management
**Importance Score: 80**

Implements domain-specific rules for:
- Selective content processing
- Explicit context inclusion mechanisms
- Workflow-aware document handling
